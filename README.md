### Now Fully Open-Source!

Bones3-Rebuilt is now open source! The previously in-development commercial version of Bones3, known as Bones3-Rebuilt, has been pushed back into the open-source community version! From now on, Bones3 is free to all users!

<br />

## What is it?

Bones3 is a Unity in-editor/in-engine script which makes it natural for users to create and modify voxel worlds and structures. Design structures in just a few clicks.

<br />

## Lets see it in action

Note that the current branch has a few more tweaks to be done before you can use it, however, here is a video of an old prototype version of Bones3 to show what we're aiming for:
